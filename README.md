WARNING:

Creating bots for automated clicking in games raises ethical concerns for several reasons:



1. **Unfair Advantage**: Using automated clickers in games gives players an unfair advantage over others who play the game legitimately. This can distort competition and undermine the integrity of the gaming experience, making it less enjoyable and rewarding for genuine players.

2. **Cheating and Exploitation**: Automated clickers can be used to exploit game mechanics, such as farming resources or currency, without the effort or skill required by genuine players. This undermines the game's design and economy, leading to imbalances and devaluing the achievements of legitimate players.

3. **Impact on Game Balance**: Games are often designed with balance in mind, where player progression and success depend on skill, strategy, and effort. Automated clickers disrupt this balance by allowing players to progress rapidly without the necessary investment of time and skill, which can diminish the overall experience for everyone.

4. **Disruption of Fair Play**: Fair play is a fundamental principle in gaming communities, where players are expected to abide by the rules and compete on a level playing field. Using automated clickers violates this principle and erodes trust among players, leading to resentment, conflict, and toxicity within the community.

5. **Devaluation of Achievements**: Achievements, rewards, and rankings in games lose their meaning and value when obtained through automated means. Genuine accomplishments are overshadowed by the prevalence of bots and artificial advancement, diminishing the sense of accomplishment and satisfaction for legitimate players.

6. **Erosion of Community Trust**: Trust is essential for fostering a positive gaming community where players can interact, collaborate, and compete in a healthy environment. The presence of bots and automated clickers erodes this trust, leading to suspicion, cynicism, and disengagement among players.

7. **Violation of Terms of Service**: Most game developers explicitly prohibit the use of third-party tools, bots, or cheats that give players an unfair advantage or disrupt the game experience. Engaging in such activities violates the terms of service of the game and can result in penalties, including account suspension or banning.

8. **Ethical Responsibility**: Players have a responsibility to uphold ethical standards and respect the rights of other players and developers. Using automated clickers in games disregards this responsibility and contributes to a culture of cheating, exploitation, and dishonesty within the gaming community.

9. 

In summary, creating bots for automated clicking in games is unethical because it undermines fair play, disrupts game balance, devalues achievements, erodes community trust, violates terms of service, and violates ethical principles of honesty and integrity. Players should prioritize genuine gameplay, respect the rules and rights of others, and contribute to a positive and inclusive gaming community.

- **Cookies Per Second (CPS) Tracking**: After running for 5 minutes, displays the current CPS count.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

- **Python**: Install Python on your system.
- **Selenium**: Install the Selenium Python package using `pip install selenium`.
- **ChromeDriver**: Download the ChromeDriver executable compatible with your Chrome browser version. Ensure the ChromeDriver executable is in the specified path.
- **Chrome Browser**: Have Google Chrome installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Set up the ChromeDriver path and Chrome options as required.
2. Replace the URL in `driver.get()` with the URL of the Cookie Clicker game or the desired webpage.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
4. Sit back and watch as the bot plays Cookie Clicker on your behalf!

## Customization

- **Loop Timeout**: Adjust the timeout duration for the main loop iteration.
- **Bot Duration**: Change the duration after which the bot stops and displays the CPS count.
- **Upgrade Check Frequency**: Modify the frequency of upgrade checks and purchases.
